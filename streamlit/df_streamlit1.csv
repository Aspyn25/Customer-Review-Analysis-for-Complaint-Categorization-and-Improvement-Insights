Vocally, that is. In the aptly titled Unfinished Monkey Business, Mr. Brown gives further creedence to the theory that the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts, and the parts, when parted out, suck. Since we last saw the swaggering Stone Roses front man, we see he may or may not have learned how make use of a Casio keyboard (see track 12), he now practices some form of cool guy martial art (see jacket photos), and probably just put this crap out 'cause he was running low on puss (personal assumption by me). By track six, with some horrid female guest vocalist, any illusion that this record was worth half my 24.85 plus tax was blown. I wonder if they accept opened merchandise for returns.",Service

Then they started to just fall apart. first a little black square panel. then another piece cracked off. actually have tape on them. Within the next year I'm thinking they'll just turn to dust. There are better headphones out there, but if you are dead set on these they don't sound bad.",Quality

Only to meet multiples of her, one of whom has a phobia of erections...If you LOVE zombie movies, stay away. The makeup is terrible, the acting is mediocre, plot? What plot?

What was the point of the film? I bought this expecting a film on the reality of following Jesus. There was only a cursory treatment of some of the issues that the church faces (i.e. church-goers vs. Jesus-followers). If I was a skeptic I could appreciate their honesty but there's nothing in it that would make me say ""OK I want to follow Jesus."" I also found their discussion about the opposite sex distracting from the message of the film. There were two positives however.

It is a film about a love triangle that is told backwards. TV's Seinfeld did a riff on Betrayal with the Indian Wedding episode. So this film is hardly groundbreaking.

Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script, which is excruciatingly bad and the direction, which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish.

In this one, Ripley--perhaps the universe's most unlucky astronaut--washes up at a penal colony that makes Alcatraz look like a Howard Johnson's at sunny Myrtle Beach. She's joined by a dour cast of British unknowns (a wasted Charles Dance being the major exception), which coupled with the pseudogothic production design, makes the film feel like a bad Henry James novel come to life. With hints--hints--at some deeper meaning, the story basically rehashes the first film; this time, though, the apparent innovation is that prisoners are picked off one at a time by a fast-moving alien that has combined with canine DNA. Masochists undoubtedly will enjoy scenes like the child from the previous film, Newt, being autopsyed, but most viewers will just shake their head at this relentlessly unhappy movie.",Design

Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent.

The two great causes of persecution in this century have been atheism (particularly under the former Soviet Union and its vassal states) and racism (under the Thousand Year Reich, during its decade or so under the sun). Also ripe for blame are political ideology and territorial ambition. Clearly, something else is happening--call it man's inhumanity to man. It doesn't seem reasonable to blame religion for a common human failing. ----- Arthur C. Clarke is a fine thinker when he sticks to his area of expertise.

The audience didn't need the very explicit lesson in Digestive Diseases. That scene aside, there was much I liked about the remainder of this movie. Pardon me for my sensibilities.

Was Hardy afraid of writing a happy ending for this unconventional pair, or did he want to display the worst-case effects of a rigid social code of behavior?

The climax was predictable and silly, and held no enjoyment for me.Scarpetta is overbearing, controlling and convinced of her own, singular wisdom as she seemingly fights against everyone else in law enforcement. Absurd. Lucy's situations are irrational and her character continues to be focused on her lesbianism (sounds like Ellen).

Within a few months of owning the pot, the handle to the water reservoir broke. An end of the plastic handle pulled off the lid. No problem, I just screwed it back in. A month later it pulled out again. This time, I unscrewed to the handle to find that the screws were only held in by a metal collar embedded in the plastic. The metal collar somehow stripped and pulled out of the plastic. The handle was permanently broken. I pressed the handle and lid back on and started filling the kettle through the pour. The screws holding the handle on the lid started to rust.I also found the pour handle clunky. If you don't hold it level, it will pop open unexpectedly and splash water out.

McDowell tells Louis about the story of Dorian Gray and how he made a pact with the devil. Louis or Dorian now writes in blood and he soon has eternal youth. This very interesting movie gets it fuel towards the middle but it can't help it. Very predictable. Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange, I:Spy) is wasted in my mind and why the hell is this movie introducing Ethan Erickson? He has been in a movie or two before this and a tv series..come on people get with it. Erickson is an ok actor and he does some ok acting in this.

Young, cheerful, well-spoken and winning, McGregor is the most charming Iago I have encountered in any medium. For awhile, that is very nearly enough. One understands why people like and trust this man; one also understands why no one takes him seriously as lieutenant material. But as the play progresses and Iago's cruelty deepens, McGregor's unvarying amiability seems incongruous. A strange countertextual interpretation emerges, reminiscent of Auden's trickster theory but with a novel twist of its own. In brief, Iago tries to play a harmless joke on Othello, only to see his prank spiral out of control. The poor man is forced to improvise desperately as he struggles to resolve the mess he unwittingly created. Iago as the Boy who Cried Adulteress, a feckless but innocent victim of events: that is indeed a novel take on the play, and it would be fascinating if it weren't ludicrous.",Design

To make matters worse, his prose style is ponderous and leaden, deliberately overcomplicated and abstruse, less animated than Al Gore.

I almost felt like shutting it off a few times, but luckily De Niro's acting kept me from hitting the stop button.I'm sure when this movie came out it was shocking and disturbing, since there wasn't much like it back then. However, by today's standards it really falls flat on it's face. I would not recommend this film to anyone, although if you're really curious about it feel free to give it a try. Obviously there are those who like really bizarre pointless movies like this. Just don't say I didn't warn you!",Design

I bought this video for my pre-school aged nephews as a Christmas gift. I thought a Rankin Bass video would be good/safe for children. I finally watched it with them the other day. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this movie for anyone. The characters in the story swear. A haggish woman swears at the unicorn saying ""Damn you, damn you!"" The knight/hero character says ""Damn."" A troll type creature says something like ""What the Hell, am I supposed to look at."" and a magician takes God's name in vain after being accosted by a tree he brought to life, which is a buxom ""woman tree"" who makes a pass at the magician. Shocking. If my nephews went up to their parents and used these expressions from the movie, they would be reprimanded by their parents who do not talk like that.

This Movie just didnt make sense and was full of holes that were never filled or explained by the movies end(and I CLAPPED when the film FINALLY ENDED)! The Only Good Performances were by James Gandolfini who was very Convincing(made me totally forget Tony Soprano) and patricia clarkson ws Good!

Now, at 18-20 months, the bike isn't so great -- when she tries to go forward, the back of her feet hit those rear wheels - every time! I've tried every height setting on the seat and it doesn't make a difference. She always wants to ride her bike, but gives up after just a few feet - who would want their feet to get hit all the time! The rear wheels are just a few inches too close to the seat.We will be looking for a replacement. Disappointing.",

Cheap toy. Falls apart easily.: I was looking for an inexpensive construction toy for my 3 year old son. This looked like a fun play set but it is a little lame. The crane falls apart when you spin it because it does not clear the back of the set. I thought the crane would move up and down but it has plastic 'ropes' that are fixed and do not move. The ramps detach when you move it. The wrecking ball knocks down the blue shed easily but too easily for my taste. Makes for a high mom/dad maintenance requirement to reset it over and over. The die cast trucks are what you would expect for the price. I expected the toy to be a little on the flimsy side since it was inexpensive I just wish the crane really worked and it held together better.,

And plus, Michael Myers should have been played by Kane Hodder, than he would have been a lot creepier than whoever plays Myers now. Jamie Lee Curtis was an extremely bad actor, and her voice was just too manly!

Almost all the characters seem narcissistic and flippant. There are so many characters introduced who are carrying zany, personal issues, and we are supposed to care about these. But the reader has no motivation to care, due to the disorganized storyline.The attempt to create a warm reunion of people who care about each other falls short.

Some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods. A lot of ""real life"" examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approach.Probably the most novel idea that came across was that it's better to be a ""good enough"" parent than a perfect one.

I felt like I was reading a character study by James Joyce.This book did not have the memorable characters characteristic of McMurtry novels. Imagine Lonesome Dove being a character study of Woodrow Call, it certainly would not win a Pulitzer. Maybe I prefer the Lonesome Dove saga better.

Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the cliché for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away.

It's probably one of the most unique things ever written: the only book that could be considered both completely a children's story and completely a book for adults. The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it's grossly over-annotated. For scholars this may be very helpful, but sadly enough a lot of the notes are either irrelevant to non-professors or provide critical instead of historical or biographical commentary which, in my opinion, ruins the greatest delight of the book: AAIW/TLG are highly interpretable and symbolic stories, but unfortunately the commentator is always interrupting like a nagging pedant before the reader has a chance to reflect.

Although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability, the series from the Gesell Institute (Your One Year Old, Your Two Year Old, etc. etc.) provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages. ""Raising Your Spirited Child"" is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child.

This film does not work as a good rock satire like ""This Is Spinal Tap"" because it offers nothing resembling insight into that world. It does not work as a horror comedy because it's stabs at macabre humor fall flat. It does not even work as a good comic re-working of ""Phantom of the Opera"".

But I tried two different positions with the Terk and its 10db amp was only able to bring in three or four local DT stations at best. Analog reception proved even worse. When I took off the Terk and replaced it with a coventionally-designed, less expensive indoor antenna with a 45db amp in those same positions, the difference in performance was amazing...I could get between 12 and 15 DT channels. In conclusion, my advice is to avoid the hype about unusual antenna design and go for maximum decibel amplification. It's that extra power that made the difference for me. Sorry Terk...",

The Vietnam war sequences were intense and stunning, and it immediately grabbed my attention. The film, however, then starts to get shaky after the Colonel (Jackson), is charged with murder for opening fire on a seemingly unarmed crowd of innocent protesting Yemenese civilians. From this point the film turns into a half-baked courtroom drama, then leaves the viewer with a very premature ending. I think it would have been a better decision on the director's part to actually show how the head of National Security was brought down, rather than just writing about it in the end.If you're looking for a great war movie, get ""Saving Private Ryan"", and if you're looking for an intense courtroom drama get ""A Few Good Men"", or ""A Civil Action""",

I had my son buy a Linksys card because the router that he's sharing at school is a Linksys, but which refused to recognize the Proxim card that works with my D-Link. I think all of this indicates just how imature this technology is. It probably ain't you if it doesn't work.Also, DLink does a pretty good job of updating their firmware, and you probably want to take the time to update the BIOS (easy, just follow the fairly clear instructions) before you start loading MACs and enabling things (you can't import your old settings after you flash the bios - you start over from the beginning).",

Yeah I think that new fans (people that started to listen to Kiss after the reunion) might enjoy this. It has all of the elements of classic Kiss, but it's missing something.Do I think that the prime motivation for this was the money?Yes. Purely for cash. It's nice that the fans had something to go with the tour that was happening at the time, but this album doesn't age very well, mainly because this album wasn't very good in it's conception, and was executed poorly.In retrospect, Kiss has made worse albums. ""Unmasked"" comes to mind. Peter Criss' solo album was weak, but at least an effort was made. ""Animalize"" was poor, but Kiss was playing catch-up, and was breaking in a new guitarist too.Some of the tunes are catchy enough, but that wears off quickly. Based on the merit of the somewhat catchy songs, I rated this 2 stars. Other than that, not much here.",

Toby (the main character) was pretty cardboard. She was an ER doctor yet when it came to danger she was a wuss. What the? She ended the story very abruptly. I want to know what happened with Dr. Dvorak and I want to know what happened to Wallenberg and everyone.I do not recommend this book at all. I'll admit it's okay but come on!

I have been disappointed many times by movies made from books I have read, but never on this grand a scale. Tom Savage has written only a handful of books, but they are all edge-of-your-seat thrillers, so I was very excited to hear ""Valentine"" was being made into a movie. And if it had been made properly it would have been good. Instead, a horrible script in the hands of a truly terrible director turned this masterpiece into a shameful mess. I urge everyone who saw this movie and hated it as much as I did to read the book. It is nothing like the movie.

Instead, I felt as though I had been accosted by one of those people who insist on showing you their boils and bunions while you are trying to eat your lunch.

Then I was given the run-around because they tried to say the cord was damaged after it was delivered to the store that sold it, but the store said it was GE's responsibility.Basically, don't buy this microwave if you expect GE to honor the warranty.

It's enough to make you vomit. Mr. Dickens should have made this a much shorter novel, or maybe even a short story. It still would have been boring, but maybe not as boring.",

The book describes unimportant or familiar concepts (like the traditional relational model) in too much detail and new or important concepts (like the Oracle8 object extension syntax) in not enough detail. Many of the diagrams do not appear to relate to the topics being discussed and the examples are too few and far between. I felt that the author used terminology inconsistently or at the very least did not define terms adequately. One might argue that the book is about object-oriented design and not about Oracle `syntax' but if you want to learn about OO check-out books by Booch, Jacobson, Fowler, Rumbaugh, Wirfs-Brock, etc. If you want to learn about Oracle objects try ""Oracle8 Design Using UML Object Modeling"" by Dorsey et. al.",

Yes $1.90 is a fair price to pay for 1 pen, but if I had known it was only one I certainly would not have paid $7.46 for them to mail me one pen! Sounds a little too much like a scam to me. The seller was good enough to refund my money after I contacted them, so if you have bought this pen thinking you would get 12, definately contact them and demand a refund. They certainly aren't in any hurry to correct the description as it has been over a month since I bought it and it still says 12 pens.Regarding the pen itself, it is far from perfect. It will occasionally spurt out a large amount of paint onto your work with no warning, making a mess of everything, including your clothes.

The author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that Islam does not work.

I did not enjoy this book at all. With her tale of loneliness and a tragic ""lovers' pact"" set in the cold and unforgiving New England snow, Edith Wharton attempts to draw us, the readers, into the black pit of despair known as her life. She succeeds marvelously. _Ethan Frome_ is a prime example of how literature can effectively evoke emotion. Wharton was an unhappy woman, and while reading her book, I was unhappy as well. Even though his story is tragic, one cannot sympathize with Frome; he has suffered for most of his life and will continue to suffer for the rest of his life, but his own choices took him there.

I complained to MS Press and MCP regarding this statement and a rep from MCP.com admitted (via email) that 'no one source of reference is sufficient to pass the exam'.

That seam has also shrunk so is not only is much thicker in that area than the rest of the toy but also smaller. You can sort of see the seam in the pictures (look for the smaller part). The result is the toy only slips until it hits the seam and given the resistance the seams causes, even does that poorly. I have had other brands of this toy and never noticed a seam and they work quite well (are very hard to hold), but this one is pretty much worthless. It can easily be picked up and needs to be forced to slide in your hand.

The 5.1 Surround sound echoes and sounds unbarable. Options to change the language to Japanese, and add/remove subtitles would've been nice, as I don't care for dubs. The picture's quality is really bad--there's scratches, and what not, making it seem like a bad video transfer. Still, the promo's pretty cool, the animated intro by Mothra's kinda neat.

The idea is awesome-a Dark Hunter falls in love and impregnates a half Appollite who is destined to die. But once again, the execution of this idea sucks! And it doesn't even make sense half the time. For example, Wulf is squeamish about drinking Cassandra's blood and initially refuses. Even though it would save her life! And Cassandra accepts this. Come on, give me a break. Plus the ""out"" that Ash gives them in the end is way too convenient. I will try a couple more books in the series because I did like Night Pleasures and Dance with the Devil, but if they are anything like this I'm done.",

She doesn't seem to have the range or depth to portray the complexities of the relationship between M.J. and Parker.

If you want to enjoy this movie, see it first then read the book by Susan Isaacs. You should look it up on Amazon too and see how highly it is recommended. I read it first and the movie was an unmitigated failure and disappointment to me. I could just cry thinking about it. I really wish they would make another movie out of it, but this time do it right and just follow the book which is just too perfect and which one cannot go wrong in following. Okay enough talk, read the book, forget the movie.",

I read with interest the last few pages where I found out that Wolfe's editor had to piece together several parts of this book, and then he had to write many pages in order to tie this mess together. All of this occured after Wolfe's death. I believe this is a collection of ramblings from Thomas Wolfe.

There were battles that never took place. In fact, fighting was the main focus of this movie. Anything that had any hint of spirituality was obliterated from the movie.

Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion.

House's argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument, an argument which goes something like this: many impressionist works and also those by Manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and technique,they are thus subversive,disruptive and oppositional and as a result political.

I didn't like the characters enough to care what happened to them and I didn't believe what happened to them when it did happen. The blonde is not believable and she is unlikely as the realistic sexual interest for Owen Wilson (unless he is OWEN WILSON - ACTOR and not the character in the movie).This is not a movie that I will watch again.

I also didn't have an extensive toolkit to be able to redrill and enlarge the pre-drilled holes to make the assembly much easier. Things were so tight, I couldn't drive the screws in even with a powertool. Otherwise they looked good quality construction and should suit smaller sized rear surround speakers.

These would have been much clearer if the authors omitted to present all these useless options such as PUBLIC identifiers. Chapters 10, 11 and annex A paraphrase the MathML specifications. The MathML specs, freely downloadable online, are unusually clear themselves so the book does not bring much. I would have liked a word about the XSIL format, an index for the CD, and a correct table of content.

In fact, I'm researching this book online today because just now (in my early 30s) I suddenly had a flashback to the horrible scene of Birdie's burning. I read this book when I was in 4th or 5th grade and, like others have said, the sickening feeling it gave me-- not just the burning scene, but the ugliness of the whole moral universe of that book-- has stuck with me all these years. It's *not* that I believe in coddling and sheltering children from the harsh realities of life. I read plenty of books as a child that featured cruelty, heartlessness and violence, and *none* of them disturbed me as deeply as this one did. Based on my first-hand experience of how this book reads from the perspective of a child, I wholeheartedly advise parents not to subject their children to it. There are better choices.",

Tobey Maguire did his best to convince us that he really is a wet noodle. His snivelling self-conflicted, let-me-show-you-my-feminine-side routine was a bit overplayed. For a minute I thought that it was the exact character that he played in Cider House. Somehow I couldn't help imagining Roger Ebert with a toothy grin, ramming popcorn in his mush while fawning over Maguire's touching portrayal of a superhero in conflict. Seriously, this was a casting disaster that the marketing department saved. A few reviews ago somebody mentioned ""not seeing enough of maquire's body."" Was that a joke?

The acting was very convincing and all the stuff they say about the powerful acting of Marlon Brando and the convincing youth and innocence of the one-hit-wonder girl that starred with him is valid. It was worth watching, but probably not worth owning. It's ultimately very depressing and doesn't really leave you holding on to anything.

It's about a guy who has amnesia whenever he goes to sleep, and he ends up witnessing a murder.....what's so funny about that? I honestly feel that this is one of the worst if not ""THE"" worst movie ever made. This was even worse than ""Ishtar"" folks. I don't have any desire to see this again, and I won't own it either.

If so, then you're gonna love it; if not, at least you'll get some laughs.Mind you, it's not that I object the fake look, dubbed dialogue, hammy overacting or holier-than-thou attitude of everyone concerned in this dated political flick from the sixties; I mean, we were all pretty much ridiculous ourselves back then.

He was, after all, an Arab, and the Arabs has long cherished the word as art (hence their beautiful calligraphy and poetry). But this book was beyond dry.

There are some other allegations against Krishnamurti as well but the lack of any objective evidence indicates they are likely a projection of personal bitterness.

His performance is bad to the point of wanting to throw something at the screen just out of sheer rage. The screenplay is a joke and the dialog rages from bad to much worse as the movie progresses and the special effects are so badly done that the monsters would have been better off if they were puppets instead. Some of the actors in the film are better than the film itself with great performances by Rachel Weisz, who is the only ray of light this movie really has and Djimon Hounsou, who is the only actor who does his comic book character any justice.

After a few cool tunes like ""Mope"" and ""Hell Yeah"", the album relys on its shock value of Bad Touch to carry through the rest of the album and deliver energy to such desperate songs like A Lapdance Is So Much Better When The Stripper Is Crying, that steals from country, badly, and loses its charm fast. It seemed like an entire CD of garnish, and no real substance, no meat. It felt rushed and choppy, with inane skits in the middle that aren't that funny, despite a chuckle-worthy phone conversation with one of the mothers about vaginas.

Weisz's performance is much too rich and powerful for a movie like this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essence there is no reason to even stay till the end.

However, these are all very basic elements of trading that all the traders should learn in the first chapter of trading. In other words, the book only covered the story (and some stock trading 101) which do not teach readers (especially the very beginners) what practical set-ups or methods are used to be profitable in trading stocks.

It is ridden with edge enhancement (halos on contrasting edges) and severe noise reduction (smoothing the image to reduce film grain -- AND detail). This is so severe that film elements such as arrows and spears in the battle at the beginning are not visible. It's barely an upgrade over DVD, and simply not what a movie of this caliber deserves.

The commercial and ads make it look like it's another Spider-Man, but be warned, it's not. The action scenes you see in the commercials are the only scenes with anything interesting shown in them, and most of the movie is just Peter Parker sitting in his aunt's house drinking tea, and/or hanging out with Mary Jane, who has a more boring character than she did in the first one. This movie has the audacity to call itself an action movie, but it is more of a teen angst drama, with one or two scenes of action. In fact, I do not see why this movie got a PG-13 rating for violence. It's closer to a G. This movie is a BIG letdown after the first one, and it will not be on anyone's future list of favorites (or at least, I hope not).",

Unfortunately, while she gives her all, the rest of the movie is in self destruction mold all around her with bad special effects, very bad dialog and a story that makes no sense what so ever.I stand with the majority, Rachel Weisz is the only good thing about this film, so wait for Dvd to see this film and in the mean time rent Runaway Jury or the Shape of things.

Beyond thet its as worthless as Keaton's cheap short films (of which there are two on this DVD). The films all usually have very little intelligence in scripts (though Battling Butler was almost a smart Keaton movie). The sets look like they cost about 50 bucks to make (on the shorts and almost every last one of his long films ---this movie only looks grand mostly because of the passenger ship--the sub at the end looks like a $10 prop set).

But since I am inclined to base my rating on the DVD itself, I'll not count that against it. My big complaint with Bladerunner is that the movie was released with two versions and only one is present on the DVD. Thus, the viewer is forced to watch the Director's Cut. The DVD is also a little shy on extras. The movie itself isn't too bad, although its pace is a tad slower than many other good science fiction movies and may cause many viewers to become bored. I suggest holding off on purchasing this DVD as it is rumored to be scheduled for re-release around December of this year. Hopefully the new release will have both versions of the film and the additional extras such a famous film deserves",

Now I realize that perhaps this musical is one to be heard and not seen, at least not beyond an unpretentious summer camp or youth group presentation, the perfect venues for this show. Yes, Osmond performs nicely in the role of Joseph. But everything else about this production is so overdone that watching it, for me, is like seeing a favorite childhood friend grow up to become a cheap circus performer. The two stars I give this video are for the music itself. But I certainly don't understand why Lloyd Weber chose to add the FINALE song ""Any Dream Will Do"" to the BEGINNING of the show.",

Of course, in reality, everyone who espouses these ideals, such as the aforementioned Soros, really want wealth and power for themselves. As a result, this is a simpleminded and boring approach to a future history novel. If it weren't written by HG Wells, probably no one would pick it up.

I do not mind watching a movie that is making the case that war is bad...war is bad, even though sometimes it is necessary. However, the movie itself jumped all over the place. As another review said, the relationships were poorly built. At first the animated portions of the film were interesting in an artsy way, but they kept coming back and were over used. The battle/war itself should have been more focused upon. The Crimean War was badly fought and this could have been a much better movie if it had shown the poor quality of generalship on both sides instead of just showing the character of the British and French generals.",

The '63 version was brilliantly plotted and paced, with one of the greatest ending lines in film history. The 1999 version has none of this.

The special effects, the film's only redeeming feature, are sub-par because they are used in a hideously predictable way. A horror film that doesn't scare at all. Actors who are best suited for roles in the adult film industry and a script which was evidently buried in the desert and never found. Who the hell green-lighted this effects-laden dungheap? I've wasted my money on other film like Deep Impact and Conspiracy Theory, but this film was a waste of my time! I could have spent those 125 minutes doing something else. Maximum Overdrive, the Emilio Estevez tour de force, was at least brainless fun. This film is just brainless. Do Hollywood a favor and buy or rent some pornography or Faces of Death instead of this cinematic black hole. Don't give them your money!

It was worse. In fact, it was so bad, I laughed my way through it (along with the two friends who accompanied me). There are so many digital effects that the house seems alive, indeed, but computer geeks set free with a big budget don't creep me out. They're just annoying. So is the movie. The house shape-shifts, sighs, moans--hell, even the door-knocker gets a reaction shot. Zeta-Jones's leather hipboots manage to out-act her, and Lili Taylor is hilariously bad as Eleanor. (""I've got the save the children!"" Wha?) Liam Neeson is even less interesting than he was in THE PHANTOM MENACE, if that's possible.

Danger of scalding and steam burns!It worked adequately for rice vermicelli, which one would normally just soak in boiling water anyway. When I tried it with penne, the pasta pieces on the bottom of the container didn't even get wet from the hot water, never mind cooked! I still had to remove the pasta at the end of the so-called cooking time, and transfer it to a pot of boiling water in order to get it cooked!This so-called pasta cooker is a waste of time.

The premise was fantastic. However, the book just dragged on and on. The hero of the story, The Duke of Jervaulx, was excellently portrayed. You could easily feel his pain when he is forced into an asylum for the insane. However, the book's heroin, Maddy, was a bit out of control. A devout Quaker, she was torn between the life she always knew and the life with the Duke. While I really liked most of the characters, she just annoyed me to no end. Could she be more indecisive? The book eventually lacked closure with the secondary characters (the blind father and the former mistress) and should have resolved the books main issue of the Duke losing everything or not. For a 532-page book, it should have tied things up a bit neater instead of just the ""love conquers all"" typical ending.",

But the fact I can set it to only alert visually is great. We have a vacation home so I add the county number for that location when we are there. Most of those alerts are snow related and it really saved me once because we don't receive local stations there and a big snowstorm popped up out of the bright blue sky.I originally gave it five stars but knocked it down because of the user interface.

I was very saddened by how dissapointing it turned out to be. I'm sorry, Michael Pitt is the wrong choice to play Kurt Cobain (even if this is just inspired after the famous late musician). The trouble is, I don't think anyone could really play Kurt. I suppose there are people in this movie (Kim Gordan of Sonic Youth and the director Gus Van Sant) who actually knew Kurt while he was alive, so they know something I don't obviously. Regardless of the mis-casting, in my opinion, the film is terribly slow and ultimately kind of pointless. We already know how it's going to end (like with ""Elephant"") but the same director asks that he keep our attention spans going till the end to satisfy his obsession with these real life tragic outcomes.

The author keeps jumping around from person to person, changing narrative perspectives. I therefore had no idea who the ""hero"" of this novel was supposed to be.

Kimi is the most gross and irritating of the babies. Wearing that stupid little diaper, always so happy. She won't be so happy when I kick her between the legs. Also, those stupid little cowboy boots. She really sucks. I'd like to see her get really injurewd and cry. That shown her!!! The movie was good, but she stinks.",

Huston is superb as Calamity Jane, and Melanie Griffith is a great madame.But this version has been hacked to death by some uncaring editor. It has lost it's continuity and is very dissappointing.",

""It's in the Rain"" is a beautiful song. The rest sound like they were rushed to be completed in order to meet the release date.I have all of her other cds and I usually enjoy them, but this is the first one that I only like one song. Creatively, this one is missing something. She also looks silly on the cover.So far in 2005, the only artist to release a completely amazing cd is Madonna with ""Confessions on a Dance Floor."" Maybe Enya could call Madonna's producer. She needs a new sound. It's time to reinvent yourself, Enya!",

Might be interesting to the history buff, but if you want clear, relevant information on how to build a wooden boat... this book isn't for you. There are many others to choose from - I'd recommend Buehler's Backyard Boat Building and Gerr's Strength of Boats as two helpful books I've read so far.",

I had to ask myself if this is the downfall of Morgan Freeman. I don't know why a respected actor, such as Morgan Freeman, would take on such a script. This want to be ""aliens"" movie leaves much distaste with it's gorry scences and lack of script. Save your time and money!This movie starts out with a lot of potential. After the first alien comes out of the persons butt, with LOTS of blood, I was ready to turn my head and read a book, which I should've done. Graphic scene after graphic scene is what this movie is about. Unless you are into blood and evil creatures, do not buy this movie!!!!",

It gives me chills just thinking of it.Grand Prix: Great cinematography! The melodramatic story can be a bit much, but the movie in widescreen is spectacular.Days of Thunder: Just plain fun. Not that accurate, but a fun movie...and it's a Bruckheimer!Don't even bother with Driven unless you can borrow it from a friend. Don't pay to watch this piece of unrealistic, hollywood shlock.",

The first couple of chapters were really promising, but then the author suddenly lost track of where she was going. Stilted broken part-way descriptive sentences. No serious romance going on. I really didn't care if they ended up together. I suggest Karen Marie Moning for really great time travel romance, or for the serious time travel enthusiast - Diana Gabaldon's Outlander. Both authors have never written a dud. This was definitely a dud, no offense intended to the author of course. It just didn't happen.",

Yes, it has almost - ALMOST - all of Elvis's greatest hits but where is ""One Night""? And why, why, why would they dare to include Elvis's horrendous live version of ""Polk Salad Annie"" and omit a classic like ""One Night""? It is for that glaring omission and that glaringly bad inclusion that I give this collection a rating of 4 rather than 5. Hey, I love Elvis Presley's music as much as anyone but he had no business recording ""Polk Salad Annie."" There's only one version of that song that should ever be heard and that's the original by the song's writer, Tony Joe White.",

I am an action junkie; and this movie looked like tons of action. It was not. They must have shown all of the action scenes in the preview.

I believe the 2nd edition is better - because it has some extra pages and these last few pages are supposed to be better! I find that hard to believe ... The authors do not know how to write a technical book - they are belligerent! The book wanders all over the place - no details at all - or none of any consequence! If the publishers had any conscience they would send me the last section of the new edition FOR FREE! This was one of the worst computer books that I have ever run across ... AVOID other books by these authors!,

While enjoying the format, the reviewer felt the book didn't deliver on its promises but acknowledges its usefulness for beginners.",0.75,"Add a section with specific resources and recommendations for LSAT prep, personal statement writing, and letter of recommendation strategies.","Not an ""ultimate guide"": Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.",

It isn't that this is a bad bowl, just that it is not as good as it could be (try Rubbermaid instead). It's too shallow for most baking that requires using a mixer first (it splatters everywhere), and the handle is so inconvenient when you try to pick it up to pour out the contents. They missed the mark on ergonomic design here.",

Include SAT score conversion tables.","Useless, Horrible, and Filled with Typos!: This book was filled with an unbelievable number of mistakes. On every test, it always gives wrong line numbers and misspells many, many, many words. Often (a few times a page) it forgets to leave spaces between words. There are no tables to convert your sample tests into SAT scores. And to top it off, the answer guide is often wrong. This was the worst $10 that I have ever spent.

After the reading the last chapter the book leaves you asking yourself, then what? The characters are interesting and Nancy is surely a woman to stay away from and not unlike some women I have known in my lifetime. Your led to believe in the book that the climatic scene will have something to do with the theft of a large amount of money that they have been talking about for half of the book, but it ends with indecision about the heist and it leaves the reader clueless about several points.",

Perez-Reverte provides long--I'd say overlong--descriptions both of his characters and of Seville, including, for example, list of the names of 27 bars in one section of the city.

We never did get the ""safety"" hook in. ADVICE: put on the spring covers BEFORE hooking the safety straps to the wooden pegs.

When I went to use it the third time, it was deader than a doornail. No power. I guess the stress of sitting in the cabinet for a few weeks was too much for it. Too late to return it. I've seen other reviews with a similar problem so it seems they have some quality control issues to work out and if you buy one, it's the luck of the draw if you get a 'good' one or not.

Someone else mentioned that Harrison Ford would have been better cast as the central character and I think that's pretty much dead on but the screenplay would have to have been trashed and put in the hands of someone who wanted to create something that actually represented the original and also in the hands of a more capable director. John Carpenter may be good at what he does but he was way out of his depth with this and was probably incapable of controlling Chase. Bottom line, the books very good if not great and the movie is a huge disappointment that really sucks. On the other hand, if you're a big Chase fan, go for it.",

The plot takes place in a fictional country in Latin America. The main conflict of the movie is that Meg Ryan's husband gets kidnapped by gorillas. Throughout the movie he is abused, denied of a shave or a shower, and is put to rotten work. Russell Crowe is the man in charge of working out a deal with the gorillas to free Ryan's husband. At the same time there is a sexual tension brewing between Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe. In my opinion, it is pretty pathetic that Meg Ryan would show interest in another man while her husband is in captivity by hostile gorillas. The whole movie is really bad, Meg Ryan is a just terrible, the only good part is the action seen at the end, but it doesn't quite save the movie.",

I tried removing and re-pluging in the power cord and it would work for a few minutes and then the monitor would again cut off. Then I tried a different approach. I removed the power cord and squeezed the end that goes to the monitor with regular pliars. SINCE THEN, THE MONITOR HAS NOT 'TURNED ITSELF OFF' ONCE!I believe that what was happening, in my case anyway, was the power cord connection at the monitor would heat up and expand and break the flow of AC. Squeezing the power cord with the pliars 'tightened up' the connection allowing the cord to maintain contact. I looked at the monitors plug hole after removing the power cord, and the connection lugs were inset into the monitor farther that I think they should be.

Usually clocking in at 740 pages plus, this version manages to squeeze every word of the masterwork into a nimble 554 pages, thanks to a total lack of margin space or chapter breaks. Laughably, the book's spine does not allow even for this squeezed assembly, so that it arrives splayed and bow-legged, in unintentional tribute to the willowy author perhaps.

I didn't give it 5 stars for the following reasons:- many of the scenes seemed to be excruciatingly long- I was not crazy about Jack Black's portrayal of Carl Denham- I may have been a little bit prejudiced having seen the original so I knew exactly what was going to happen.

Sorry Santana, I'm not interested enough to even bother although I've been a fan for MANY years. And Sony, well, you confirmed that for this consumer, you just ceased to exist. You installed software on my PC without telling me what it would do, and without informed consent. Your rootkit technology has proven to be very dangerous for consumers, seriously compromising PC security. I currently don't own anything made by Sony, and that is the way it will stay.",

This book seems to categorize all men as chauvinists, and all women (at least the target audience) as dumb blonds. Doesn't necessarily work out that way.

Unfortunately, after a few dozen pages, it seemed like the book was a good EXAMPLE of that thesis, and not an elucidation of it. It reminded me of James Joyce, and while Joyce's style can be wonderful for a novel, it kind of stinks for an expository work. My second thought is that publishers have got to stop paying people by the word.The author's point seemed reasonable and based on common-sense -- my quarrel was he could have made it more succinctly, with better support, and with less verbosity.Oh well, enough said.",

The gimmick is cute, but not successful: too much of the book (especially in the second half) is carried by the sworn statements, which are sufficiently story-telling to make it mostly a 1st-person story (albeit told from a couple different 1st-person points of view).

The lamp died after around 200 scans!I used it intermittently, so I was out of warranty when the lamp died.I've used scanners of several manufacturers, and this is the first time that a scanner lamp died on me.In sum, $300 for 200 scans is not recommendable at all.Added: I got another reason to hate this scanner.

So this means if the subject is moving around a lot, such as my daughter playing soccer, you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you can't zoom out. As long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful. I unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off, etc.Another negative is that the viewfinder doesn't show the zoomed in image, you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot, which can be difficult in bright sunlight.",

Naval buffs will find this a useful book, with numbered guides accompanying the cut-away color diagrams that offered details about the layouts of the various ships. Yet the selection of what constitutes a ""great"" warship is rather idiosyncratic. The selection is exclusively Western in its orientation, as Chinese junks, Ottoman galleys or Imperial Japanese Navy vessels completely absent. Moreover, the compilers seemed to have been unable to decide whether a great warship was an innovative one or a historic one and included selections of both, leaving out others more deserving in the process. As a result, while an interesting resource, it is a limited one that lacks a theme that could have made it a truly valuable book.",

We were both very affected by the book; it made an impression on us that the movie did not.I especially did not like the addition of another child, a girl, into the story.

There is no way to configure the device so I can browse my music through my folders.Moreover, there is no easy way to create a playlist. To do that you have to install the software that cames whith it and you can not add new musics to the playlist in another computer. All playlists editions must be done in the same computer. This is a huge limitation for me because I use a lot of different computers (home, office, notebook,...). I haven't bought an Ipod because it has the same limitations. Futhermore, the software that comes with it is terrible, much worst than Itunes.So if you organize your files into folder and would like to use this classification in your mp3 player, and if you don't want to buy an Ipod because you will be tied on in a specific computer, you SHOULD NOT BUY this device.",

There is no evidence that anyone proofread it prior to printing. It it doubtful that it was even run through a spell-check program.

The main story is great, with a great twist for an ending(or non-twist, depending on how you look at it) however, the graphic sex-scenes are just not neccessary and are way too overboard(I can't help but wonder if Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas are still proud of their work on this film?).Go ahead and call me prude, but I cannot recommend this filthy trash.",

This CD experience was flat, a disappointment. Perhaps I've just grown up too much since the 70's and need to trip back to my youth. Even so, for this genre, I'd prefer Def Leppard--more verve, more creativity, more driving power.

Clay has such an awesome voice, and this CD does little to show off his true talent. The songs are average at best and lack the kind of melodies that would truly show off Clay's gift. I've read many reviews of this CD and the most recent stated the same. It lacks any luster and will probably get lost in a pile of old CD's. Good luck next time Clay on producing some more appropriate music for your awesome voice.",

I hardly expected an unbiased opinion from the child of a broken home, but some of the none-too-subtle suggestions that Vincent was 'bi' and so on - without any factual evidence, only gossip - not to mention WHO CARES - is just too much. Another instance of licking one's emotional wounds in public, I'm afraid. Stick to the marvelous Lucy Chase Williams book, and the interesting recent book put out by Midnight Marquee.",

He continued to eat the carrots, visibly growing as he ate them. He left my garden at least 6 inches taller and with a spryness I have never seen out of the damn old mutt. I watched this scene from my window with horror and I still am not sure what to do about this. At night I can see a faint green glow coming from the neighbor's doghouse which I assume is a result of my carrot shenanigans.I only gave this product 2 starts because it grew, overnight, the largest carrots I have ever seen.

I must say I have read the Hobbit at least 100 times and yet I have never enjoyed reading it as much as when I read it with Anderson's anotations. I especially appreciated the philological background into the many proper names and archaic words that Tolkien used. What is a ""carrock""or what does ""confusticate and bebother"" mean? Now I know!I also enjoyed the immense number of illustrations that were included, many of them sketches and pictures made by J.R.R himself. Alas, they are not in color, most are black and white prints of original color pictures. If more had been invested in the visual quality of this book, it would have greatly added to the level of pleasure in the words of Tolkien that Anderson's comments bring out. Still worth the money, hopefully Anderson will add color in the next edition",

The second time I convinced myself that I had too many books on the go at the one time. The third time I told myself that I was too busy to give it the time it deserved. Frankly, I have now learnt that if you need to try for the fourth time to read something and have to force yourself to keep turning the page it is a bad sign.This is frankly the only book that I have purchased that I not only don't want anymore - but I don't want to inflict it on anyone else by giving it to charity.

Shortly afterward I heard some air and found where it was leaking and didn't think too much off it. Then in the middle of sleeping I woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it, and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor.

I thought the ending was just ridiculously stupid as was the entire movie.The commentary makes sure you will watch the dvd twice, but THAT IS IT!!!!!

The way the book was written failed to show the emotions of Soth as he committed his crimes. The author seemed to just skim over the important parts, such as the deaths of Lady Korinne, Isolde, and his two children. Even though any DragonLance novice knows the tale of Soth, this book failed in showing Soth's honour and true evil. Also the summary on the back of the book concerning Soth's quest given to him by Paladine is quite misleading since it lasts a whole chapter at the end of the book. The novel also didn't fully explain what evil magic transformed Soth and his loyal knights into Death Knights. Overall I found the book very uninspired and was disappointed by it.

Plagued by bad make-up, pathetic special effects, horrible acting, a poorly executed plot, and a lifeless and pathetic script, I can say without reservation that ""Withchouse"" is a total zero and a complete utter joke.

Photos are not always identified. Many items are discussed but not depicted in photo or sketch. The price guide in the back uses different names/descriptions than what is used in the text of the book, so you can never be sure if you are checking value on the correct item. I enjoyed the book, but if you want to learn more about various pieces of Westmoreland glass, you will need to buy other books. Unfortunately, I cannot offer advice on what others because I have not found a good one yet. Lorainne Kovar's books are GROSSLY OVERPRICED and still do not do the job they should.

Printing from other applications works just fine, so it's not my printer or my driver. I ended up using bundled software that came with my CD burner.

When You Say You Love Me has a country sound to it. I DO NOT LIKE country music. I didn't like this song either, but it got itself on in my head for hours. I did like Invincible. Clay can really shake it up. He displays his impressive range in Run To Me and Measure of Man. Perfect Day and No More Sad Songs have a rock edge. The Way and Shine and Run To Me are soulful ballads.

My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it.",

But the details he left out (just to make his useless point) is, the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month, whereas the person who doesn't own a home has to pay may be 10-15k per year for rent.

I have a 21"" plasma monitor so anything less than 1600x1200 resolution is blurry. When I tried to use 1600x1200 it was so slow that I thought it had crashed.In addition the screen scrolling is almost impossible to use because it is so jerky and delayed.",

I thought it would be cool but it wasn't. The special effects are really corny and dumb. You didn't miss out anything on the 3D because I didn't see anything realistic with it. My advice don't waste your money on this. I'm 13 years old and if I were 8 I would probably like it but now that I'm 13 I think it's the dumbest movie ever. Spy Kids was okay but this was stupid.

In this day and age most components can be bought it is the ideas that are needed. Useless book. Don't know how it had over 4 stars when I bought it.,

I think there's a date typo too where it's supposed to be the day after and they didn't change it.

Too often questionable statements by Uffindell's hero Wellington are taken at face value. Of course, the British did nothing worng in this campaign and foreigners like the Prince of Orange, Dornberg and Ziethen are to blame for Wellington's errors.

Yet he claims to offer a rebuttal to a position he doesn't remotely understand.This ill considered little book is filled with poorly examined assumptions.

She isn't. The problem is the content. After reading the first 90 pages, I put the book down, finally admitting to myself that I really didn't care what Ms. Powell thought or opined about anything. I was finding her blog-turned-book to be just one more rant from a neurotic New Yorker, a genre for which my tolerance peaked several years ago. It was never that high to begin with.Unfortunately, a friend had given me the book, thinking I'd enjoy it because of my fondness for Julia Child. Maybe that contributed to my reaction to the author. Juxtaposing herself with Julia Child invites one to think about issues of character, style and substance. On all those measures, Ms. Powell suffers.My recommendation: see the movie, but forget the book.",

The first several hundred pages have the main character (Nick Guest) doing little more than having sex, fantasizing about having sex with every other male character (major or minor), or wondering if anyone else can guess that he's fantasizing about sex.Perhaps it would be a better read for someone British, because I found it hard to appreciate the depiction of life in the British aristocracy. The character development felt very heavy-handed and repetitive, as one scene after another depicted Nick feeling embarrassed or trying to figure out how to handle a social situation.The end of the book was much more rewarding, as the web of characters unravelled and their pretensions were stripped away. I also enjoyed some clever Henry James references. Still, I don't think the investment it takes to slog through the beginning is worth it overall.",

It takes away from his lustre as being the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes. This is not a book I will read again.",

The concept is okay but Jason only appears for like 15 minutes tops. What really boggles the mind is how did he come back to life after he was in waste in N.Y.

It takes more than 5-10 minutes though for him to in fact fall asleep. So when it turns off he just starts to cry because he hasn't figured out how to turn it on again. Also just the fact that it has to be constantly turned on defeats the purpose because it just keeps my son awake. It's cute but there have been better sleep aids in the past that are not on the market any more.,

Too bad it's really poorly constructed. My 4-year-old calls me up to put it back together at least three times before she finally gives up playing with it.The fences constantly pull apart, the walls separate from the front of the stable, and there is nowhere to keep all of the accessories (which are really cute, I must say) together when the stable is folded up. You could put them in the manger, but they just fall out as soon as you pick the silly thing up.Anyway, I was REALLY disappointed with this one. Santa thought he was bringing a great toy, but it was really bad. I would highly recommend the Strawberry Shortcake house instead - it's actually well-built.",

Why did they have to make a movie about a geeky kid trying to get a guy hired to go look for his old girlfriend. I think that's a dumb idea. Cameron Diaz is pretty hot in this movie but the whole movie is just plain dumb. When I first saw this movie in the theater I thought it was allright but now that I watched it so many times on video it has gotten boring and stupid.

Send it to the retailers, promote endlessly on the aforementioned show and wait for the sales to hit the sky. What? That this CD never went to the top of the charts? Hmmm, wonder why.... Maybe because the tunes can be found in previously released albums? Or because the remixes were not remotely as good as expected? Or maybe because the good-for-all-taste compilation didn't quite work? Whatever the reason was, this is anything but a fabulous soundtrack.

The characters were annoying and obtuse, it was hard reading such a disgusting piece of lititure. Kit was such an unintelligent and snooty creature it was infurating to read about. The women were either self-centered or meek, the thought about love all the time. The men disscussed politics like a change would end the world and the men thought women were dirt.

The author sets up any number of interesting subplots (son of H is about to wed daughter of M, his arch enemy; K gets cheated out of inheriting a valuable painting by her deceased friend's family) but all these conflicts somehow just evaporate. Considering that the first 200 pages of the book are the setup, and the second 200 are one expectation after another thwarted on the part of the reader, this makes for very disappointing reading. Add to that that every character manages to lose our sympathy the second they gain it (K and C seem to become friends, even though every single recorded conversation contains snubs and misunderstandings) and I had the hardest figuring why I should care about any of them.",

I can watch them now and laugh, especially at this garbage to which the filmakers obviously had no idea what they were doing. This used to be a great series, but the last 4 or 5 have been a major disappointment. Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday steals basically every idea from Halloween and N.O.E.S., and it doesn't stay consistant with it's previous sequels.

It is a real shame as she has so many famous surfers supporting her efforts to spread yoga in the surf community. A better option is Shiva Rhea's Shakti yoga which provides excellent instruction AND a ""yoga matrix"" which allows you to create your own unique routines.

All seven of the CDs I made worked wonderfully. Transferring albums was equally easy, although I only did one. In both cases, the most difficult part was being present to press the button that manually splits tracks.After a month of use, however, the CD player would only play part of a CD--three songs--and then it would quit, locking up the unit. Powering off and back on freed up the unit, but didn't solve the problem. We have since returned the Songwriter to Linens 'n Things for a full refund.

If this book had an unknown date and author I'd of thought it was another one of those trashy ""love"" novels written by Danielle Steel. Pure crap. The only reason I can find that this novel my even be remotely considered a classic is because it was written by a woman and it is Victorian.",

Every time I put on disc number 4 and fail to find ""She's My Best Friend"" from the 'VU' album on there I'm reminded of this. I'm always left with the distinct impression that these record companies should let the fans compile the box sets.The band is great, of course. A legend. Original, timeless music and words. That's why I've given 4 stars. Having said that, the first disc of demos is for completists only. You'll probably not play it all the way through even once.Like others, I'd recommend not starting here. Buy the remastered albums (the 'banana LP' and 'Loaded' now come in deluxe double CD versions), especially the more polished mix of the 3rd untitled album. Then maybe buy this last.Oh, and get yourself the 'VU' collections. So you can hear ""She's My Best Friend"".",

It worked great until summer 2009. Thermostat burned and melted where it connects to broiler element. Char-broil customer service gladly sold me a new one - total with shipping $60.00. First time I plugged it in - which was 2 months after I received it - it melted and burned just like the first. Char-broil customer service wanted to sell me another since their parts only have a 30 day warranty. As a one time good deal customer service sent me a replacement with free return shipping of the newly burned out controller. This replacement of the replacement burned and melted just as the other two had done. However, now Char-broil won't return phone calls and ignores my emails. No response to three emails and three phone calls. Don't buy this Char-broil electric grill. It was a good product two years ago but the 2009 and later components are defective and cheap. Find a different brand. I am going to Weber grills.",

There are few movies that I will stop in the middle (in fact, I can't think of any), but this was one of them. I was very disappointed with this movie. It makes fun of Jane Austen. It criticizes everything about Jane Austen's time period. Everything in the movie seemed designed to mock, from the pond filled with scum in front of a great house to an unpolished mirror that could hardly be looked in to show the sisters reflections. It blatantly attacks Christianity ( or being faithful to your spouse before you ever even meet them, by keeping your wedding vows). As strange as it sounds, I felt like I was being attacked through the movie screen. It is a movie full of lies. Particularly the lie that by being faithful to your spouse you are missing out. The opposite is true. Hopefully, the movie improved by the end, but I couldn't make it that far to find out.",

As I travelled thro' the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which Mr Dillon strolls thro' the events at hand. The story also lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story. Mr Dillon is just to sci-fi I'm afraid.There is a quote at the start of the book and as I got near the final chapters, I was starting to imagine that the Author would be writing the finale of Mr Dillon....the quote read""To Tess, who thinks it's about time""Author, I think she may mean something else....",

This would be the same Maribeth who took a bus from Onawa, Iowa to Omaha, Nebraska, then got off in Grinnell on the way to Chicago. The only Grinnell, with a college, on the way to Chicago from Omaha, happens to be the one in IOWA!!I suppose, to some people, this is a small point.

However, I found that most of the time, about four cans out of five, it wouldn't cut the lid completely off. I'd be left with a lid slightly immersed in the can's contents and attached by a small strand of metal. I'd then have to get a small knife or fork to pry the lid out of the can and was still left with the task of getting the lid off the can without cutting myself.Based on the other reviews I'm figuring I just got a dud, so I'll replace it with another OXO opener, but not this one.",

I have read several other arabic books translated in english in both languages and i can assure you that those translations are fine, they manage to capture the beauty that is portrayed. The Koran is a magnificent holy book, unfortunately this translation gives it a poor image and does not understand what the Koran really says.

Instead of just informing you on different options (none of which would work for me and only one or so that would apply well to a full time job) this book presents a certain ideal and if the job arrangements do not fit that ideal, they're not good arrangements and you aren't a good mother.

Eragon befriends a storyteller who turns out to be a sorcerer, Just like garion. Eragon does magic in the same way Garion does, through ""The will and the word"".I could go on and on. I think Paolini counted on the fact that most people haven't read Edding's masterpiece.

Just Roy what's-his-face in a boat looking for the shark, that Jaws 2. Jaws 3 is just a stupid attack on Marine SeaWorld by a shark looking for its babies and Jaws: The Revenge was actually pretty cool because that's the one you saw the shark the most and there's a lot of gore and action.

The additional notes at the back of the book are great reading and I enjoyed the time I spent learning of Muddy Waters' life.However....there are two major mistakes in the picture subtitles. One identifies Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones as Mick Taylor. Mick had quit the band years before the 1978 photo was taken. Another photo showing Muddy and Son Sims in 1943 identifies the guitar that Muddy is holding as a National steel guitar, when it is obviously a wood bodied resonator, not a steel bodied guitar. If Mr. Gordon is this free and loose with his checking of the facts on the pictures, it leaves me in doubt as to the quality of his research on all the other data in the book.",

So even though this router has a lot of cool features ( super G, WPA, gaming mode etc. etc. ) , you are not allowed to use any of them.

The longing is there, and it is expressed well, but ultimately, the miraculous ""healing"" of the mother and her immediate death after her restoration--undermine whatever strength was in the novel.The one character that the reader has no trouble believing is Pearl, the caring maternal housekeeper.

Atwood delivers with her novel a new aspect in the various dystopias of the 20th century: the tyranny of a fundamental christian sect.Considering all these aspects one could remark that the artistic realization leaves a lot to be desired.But the final question,if the handmaid's tale is really worth reading is difficult to answer.If you are interested in becoming acquainted with dystopian novels you will be more content with one of the classic dystopias, such as Orwell's ""1984"" or Huxley's ""Brave New World"".",

So I contacted tech support realizing that I'd have to go through the usual rigamorole (sp?) to get an RMA.However, despite a very detailed email description of the problems and the various things I did to try and fix them (firmware upgrades/reinstalls, hardware resets, etc) the tech who answered me told me I'd have to contact them through telephone support.Currently (11:10 PM Eastern Time, 29 July 2003) wait times for tech support are in excess of 140 minutes!

When it comes down too it, I think this sort of physics, philospohy/spiritual theory of everything-- kind of stuff is just as undocumentable and faith based as any other sort of religious ideology.

It's voice actors aren't that good, the wooden boy has equally wooden acting, and the ending of the movie made no sense whatsoever! Come on Disney! Explain to me why Pinoccio suddenly drowns at the end of the movie when earlier on the was walking at the botton of the ocean talking to the fish without any indication that he needs air to live in the first place?! It was just plain stupid, a move to make the viewers feel bad for the little hero, when his death makes no sense!",

Instead, I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book, sadly.",

I hope that some director in the future tries to cast Smith in a role that wasn't written for him - then we will all see that he really can't act his way out of a wet paper bag.Don't buy this on DVD - wait for it to come out on one of the cable movie channels...",

It's got nothing in common with a good movie. It's a travesty!The acting, even with a so-called ""top talent"" like Christopher Lambert, is awful. The setting is almost non-existant, and the plot, ah yes, the plot ....I knew this movie would reek within the first 10 minutes.

It arrived damaged. The cellar was sent UPS in just its original box, no extra packing to protect it. The plastic around the door was cracked. The door was also hanging at an angle. I actually considered keeping it even with the damage so I plugged it in and tested the temperature with a refrigerator thermometer. No matter what setting I put it on, the temperature remained at a constant 42 degrees which is too cold for storing red or white wine. Amazon made the return easy. They sent UPS to my house to pick up the item. I was very discouraged about the idea of ordering again. I finally ordered a Magic Chef wine cellar through Home Depot.

The alleged ""humor"" never hits (NOT ONCE!) and the performances by the ""legendary cast"" range from embarrassing to downright shameful.

So each day he has to make her fall in love with him all over again. It's a touching situation and the two co-leads play this aspect of the movie with delicacy and charm. However this wasn't enough for the marketing & development people, so they added a ton of crude slap-stick and a lot of stale and offensive sexual ""humor."" This robs the movie of any chance it might have had to touch the viewer's heart, and left me wondering how the movie ever made it out of the cutting room. The earlier movie in which these two co-leads appeared, The Wedding Singer, was fortunate enough not to suffer from these drawbacks. 50 First Dates is a movie worth missing.",

The movie the odyssey took place in Greece back thousands of years ago when there was such things as mythical creatures. I really dont enjoy things like that others might. Although , there is a part I did like. I enjoyed the part of the movie when calypso(Venessa Williams) kept odysseus on the island for two years she nor her maids had not seen a man for 100 years. I thought that was very interesting. The other parts of the muvie confuse me and the names confuse me such as: Penelope(Greta Scacchi), Athene(Isabella Rossellini), Cyclopes(Reid Asato), and Eurybates(Ron Cook). Those were just a few.

Was looking forward to reading selected works by Edgar Allen Poe on my Kindle but determined immediately that it was impossible to go to a specific selection. This has been set up like that of a novel. If the reader wants to go to a certain selection scanning through every page to get to that selection is required. Using the Go To feature on the Kindle was not helpful either since a location for each story/subject was not indicated in the Table of Contents. I have read much of Poe's works previously and was looking forward to revisiting his genius but have to say that this Kindle Edition is not even worth the $0.99 that I paid for it.

There is a small hole (you can see it in the picture) and it's gotten so bad in there that it's about to rust through. I gave it two stars because it is extremely functional and easy to use.

If you want to see the full length versions of the songs in this concert, buy the VHS version because it's all there.

The book finally ends and I just didn't care.There were some good sections, such as the parents visiting day sequence when the main character was so (unjustifiably) embarrassed by her parents that her father decided to leave early. I also found the aborted relationship between the main character and the townie to be fairly interesting. Yeah, both of these sections were overdone, but there was a ring of truth to them.
